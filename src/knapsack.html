<h1> What's it all about? </h1>

<p>
The knapsack problem is a puzzle in <b>math</b> and <b>computer science</b> where there is a set of items to choose from. Each item has a <i>cost</i> such as weight or overhead, and each has a <i>value</i> such as gold or profit. The goal of the knapsack problem is to maximise the value, while staying below a cost limt.
</p>

<p>
The most well known example of the knapsack problem is where there's a bag with a maximum weight that can go in it, and a set of items which each have a weight and some kind of value, such as money or usefulness. The example above is of an RPG game, where there are items that have an amount that they could be sold for, but the character can only carry a certain amount of weight.
